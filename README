LeafSeek
========

* Welcome to LeafSeek *
(Set Your Records Free!)

LeafSeek is a new tool that helps you turn your genealogical or historical record collections into searchable online databases. Combine multiple datasets of different types -- such as birth, marriage, and military records -- into one unified searchable website. Find inter-connections in your data that you never noticed before.

With great features like built-in geo-spatial searches, pop-up Google Maps, Beider-Morse Phonetic Matching, name synonyms, and language localization, LeafSeek can help you turn your spreadsheets of names and dates into a full-featured genealogy search engine. It's designed for researchers and genealogy societies alike.

Oh, and one more thing: LeafSeek is free and open source. No strings attached.

LeafSeek is based on Apache Solr (version 3.6 pre-release) for the back-end code, and the Solarium Project (version 2.3), PHP, XHTML, CSS, and jQuery for the front-end code.
